# Sasani’s Music

***Heckin' big ol' WIP***

## Goals
### Availability
Books of arranged music can get expensive. As someone living on disability, my budget is strict. While I’d like to buy more music books I end up spending on new instruments. Whoops!

 I might have enough to create a decent compilation someday, but currently everything here is a single PDF per piece. If truly needed, contact me through [GitHub](https://github.com/Sasani-Likes-Penguins/Sasani-Music) and I can smoosh individual PDFs into a single PDF. Just let me know what pieces and instrument, &c.

### Accessibility
- 

## Information
While the music here is under categories for specific instruments I play, if something is needed in a different key to suit a different instrument, please contact me through [GitHub](https://github.com/Sasani-Likes-Penguins/Sasani-Music) and I’ll be happy to transpose something.

I can add various types of tablature as well beyond what I typically do such as jianpu, kalimba tabs, &c., so feel feel to request those as well.

Due to my health and energy, it might take some time to do it, especially creating tabs or using different music notation, but I’ll do my best to keep in touch so it won’t look like I’ve abandoned the request.
