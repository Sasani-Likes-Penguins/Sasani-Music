# Sasani-Music

This repository contains my original arrangements, example recordings creative by the software I use, and will eventually have recordings of myself playing.

In the future I will add my own compositions.

## More Instrument Info
I only write/arrange for what I have which are:
* Soprano, alto, and tenor recorder
* B♭, A, and F♯ Native American style flutes
* A 17 tine Kalimba in C, and a 21 tine kalimba that I haven't decided what key to tune to.
* A steel tongue drum—also needing a decision on what tuning to use (it's kind of a pain to tune it)
* Bass ukulele (nothing here for that yet as I'm still very new)
* A flute tuned to Makam Hicazcâr Aʂiran, (A Byzantine or A double harmony I think?)
* Irish whistles in the key of D major, B major, and G Mixolydian (Any of the D Major whistle music works for both high and low D whistles)
* Frame drum (I'm still learning, so nothing present yet)
* Guqin doesn't have anything yet as I will be a beginning when it arrives today (2025-10-13)

## Future instruments
I have several instruments in mind I'd love to learn, so eventually hope to include music for the following:
* Harp/Lever Harp/Irish lever harp, etc.

## The Music
* Irish whistle music have alternate PDFs with whistle tabs
* Native American Style flutes with also have alternate PDFs using the Nakai tab system

## Future plans
* I'd like to add some tips and guides at some point in the future.

*Readme and repo is a WIP*
